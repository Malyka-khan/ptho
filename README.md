 SVM classifier on images of cats and dogs. Here's a summary of the steps:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

You defined two categories: cats and dogs.
You read images from directories named cats and dogs inside a folder called IMAGES/.
Each image is resized to (150, 150, 3) and flattened before being added to the dataset.
Model Training and Tuning:

You split the dataset into training and testing sets using an 80/20 split.
You defined an SVM model and performed hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV on different kernels and C values.
After finding the best hyperparameters, you trained the model and evaluated it on the test set.
Model Evaluation:

The code prints the accuracy and a detailed classification report.
A few suggestions to enhance the code:
Normalize the Data:

Consider normalizing the pixel values (e.g., dividing by 255) to improve model performance.
Handle Class Imbalance:

If your dataset has imbalanced classes, you might want to adjust for that, either by using class weights or by augmenting the data.
Use Data Augmentation:

To increase the size of your training set and reduce overfitting, you could use data augmentation techniques like rotations, flips, etc.
Visualize Some Results:

You can visualize some predictions to see how well the model is performing on individual images.
